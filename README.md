**This is a fully responsive Modern Full Stack Ecommerce application with Payments functionality**. With Modern design, animations, the ability to add and edit products on the go using a CMS, all advanced cart functionalities, and most importantly the complete integration with Stripe so that you can cover REAL payments.

Technologies and Tools used:
- ReactJS
    - Folder and file structure, hooks and refs
- Advanced State Management of the entire application using React Context API
- Next.js Best Practices such as
    - File-based routing, Data fetching that allows server-side rendering and static generation which makes your websites incredibly optimized (show getServerSideProps, getStaticPaths, getStaticProps), with using Next.js as a backend endpoint.
- Integration of Stripe to manage payments, products, shipping rates, and the entire checkout process
- Content managment using Sanity. Sanity is the unified content platform thatâ€™ll make the making of our entire app possible. <show sanity desk>
- Sanity allows me to focus on developing the application without having to worry about the content, file storage, and databases.
